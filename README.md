Solution landscape
==================

Visualize and explore the solution landscape of Infomap based on clusters of network partitions. The solution landscape notebook helps you:

1. Identify how many times you need to run Infomap for a solution with given resolution and accuracy

3. Explore how node assignments change between different solutions

The notebook uses Infomap as an example, but works for any network clustering algorithm producing two-level or multilevel partitions.
